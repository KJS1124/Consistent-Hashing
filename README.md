# Distributed Computing Learning Project

Welcome to the Distributed Computing Learning Project! This project is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for Java developers interested in exploring distributed computing concepts and technologies using Spring Boot. Whether you're new to distributed systems or looking to deepen your understanding, this project offers a collaborative environment to experiment, learn, and grow.

## Project Overview

- **Architecture**: The project is started with a leader-slave architecture, where a leader node coordinates the activities of slave nodes. This architecture is commonly used in distributed systems to manage resources and tasks efficiently.
- **Consistent Hashing**: Consistent hashing is used to distribute data across nodes in a way that minimizes reorganization when nodes are added or removed from the system. It ensures a more even distribution of data and reduces the impact of node failures.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository-url]`
2. Import the project into your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse)
3. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean install`
4. Run the application: `mvn spring-boot:run` or run the main class directly from your IDE
5. Explore the codebase and documentation to understand the project structure and concepts
